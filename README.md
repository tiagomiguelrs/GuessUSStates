# U.S. States Guessing Game

## Description
This project is an interactive U.S. states guessing game built using Python's turtle module. The game displays a blank map of the United States, and the player is prompted to guess the names of the states. Correct guesses are marked on the map, and the game continues until all 50 states are guessed or the player chooses to exit.

## Features

State Tracking: Keeps track of the states guessed correctly and marks them on the map.

Data Persistence: Saves the states that were not guessed to a CSV file for future learning.

User Interface: Uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to prompt the player for state names and display the results.
